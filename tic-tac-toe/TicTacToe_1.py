''' Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.
"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that moves is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first. '''

Approach: Brute force. this approach walks through all the matrix more than one time to find the winner.
Time complexity: O(nÂ²)

Obs.: This approach got 'time limit exceeded' in the last test
